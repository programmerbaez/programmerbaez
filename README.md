# Hi, I'm Andrés Báez

Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Breiner Andrés Rodríguez Báez, a software developer eager to improve every day.

I hold a degree in Software Development from SENA and am currently pursuing a degree in Software Analysis and Development. I have advanced English proficiency, which allows me to work internationally and access up-to-date technical documentation.

My experience includes working with multiple programming languages ​​and frameworks for developing scalable and efficient solutions. Through personal projects on GitHub, I have strengthened my skills in code optimization, user experience (UX/UI), and best software development practices.

I am passionate about continuous learning and creating clean, maintainable software, with a special emphasis on delivering intuitive and high-performance user experiences. Outside of the technical field, I enjoy coffee and the company of cats, interests that complement my professional profile.
